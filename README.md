## Examples

1. Example 1
    - It is very difficult to view the orange colored LED during the daytime and is very harsh during the night time. It would be much better to use a softer blue LED
    - The meters in the middle of the console are oddly placed and it would require the driver to take their eyes off of the road to check on how their car is doing
    - The media system and the air conditioning control units are oddly separated and on a car of this style it does not make much sense for the air conditioning control unit to have a screen
    - The steering wheel is simplistic which works well for this car's design
    - The emergency flashers button is in a hard to reach location as you would have to contort your body to press the button when having it up higher would make it much easier to press in an actual emergency.
    - The speedometer is seen both analogous and digitally within the dashboard display, which is very useful in case one or the other stops working

2. Example 2
    - There is no gas icon on the gauge. This does not clearly indicating what the user might be looking at and also does not tell the user which side of the vehicle to fill up their tank on
    - The speedometer measures in km/h and shows the proper number for kilometers. Under the km/h is a mph designation but there is no conversion or subscripted numbers to indicate such
    - The warning lights and status symbols have optimal placement as they are not near anything else and will clearly tell the user what they need to be aware of while operating the video
    - The odometer has no indication of what it is showing and is not very useful in that respect

3. Example 3
    - The screen in the center console is very low and would require taller users to crane down to determine the information. This could potentially become very dangerous
    - The steering wheel has very clear buttons to show what each of them do without hiding the information
    - The center console is a complete button overload and is very cluttered. It looks to have an entire phone dialing pad on the right side
    - The emergency blinker button is placed very well and is convenient for a user
    - The dials on the main dashboard look to be outdated for the vehicle and does not match with the theme of the center console. The colors on this dashboard are also unmatching with the rest of the vehicle

4. Example 4
    - The screen on the dashboard is very lowly placed which would make it very difficult to read for shorter users
    - The small dials on the dashboard have far too ticks for the information that will actually be used by anyone
    - The dial on the steering wheel is very handy for changing radio stations or the volume of music
    - Fuel dial does a good job of telling the user what side of the vehicle to fuel the car
    <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22249710/112767751-156e6480-8fde-11eb-8459-af6213bece4a.png" width="500"/>
5. Example 5
    - This car has two dashboards. Enough said
    - The upper dashboard has digital interfaces that presumably determine the fuel level and speeds but the lower dashboard is completely analog
    - The steering wheel has 12 buttons on it which does not make too much sense with how close the radio controller is
    - Fuel meter has an entire sentence above it to say that it is the fuel meter
    - Decent fan placement
    - The air conditioning controller is very clear in what its too many buttons do

## List your most common features and other more rare uses of a car dashboards.
1. Common Features:
- Dials on car dashboards use the same model with a hand representing where the dial is currently at.
- Very common to have multiple dials on the dashboard for different purposes or functionality.
- Buttons on steering wheels
- Buttons for controlling side windows
- Middle of dashboard has functionality for radio or audio features
2. Rare Features:
- Dials at the middle of the dashboard instead of being only on the driver side.
- Having no dials on the driver side entirely.
- Dashboard LEDs being the same color, most dashboards use different colors for different gauges or symbols but one of our cars used orange to display most of everything.
## List the controls that the user interacts with the car dashboards.
- User has to interact with:
    - The radio on the dashboard to modify music or audio
    - Buttons to adjust the AC or heater in the car
    - Buttons on the steering wheel if available to set the car in cruise control or stop
    - Fans if the direction of air needs to be adjusted
    - Buttons for if the air flow in the car needs to go to windows or through the main fans
    - Turning on/off hazard lights
## What are some common mistakes you can make with these current designs?
- Common mistakes that can be made with these designs are:
    - Trying to figure out A/C or radio buttons can be confusing if the labels on the buttons are not clear
    - Not adding an arrow for the user to determine the location of the gas tank next to the gas level gauge
    - Not making it obvious if the vehicle is displaying miles or kilometers on cars with completely digital interfaces
    - Sometimes the locations of indicator lights is not consitent which can be confusing for users
    - Not having an indicator to show if the doors or trunk is open
    - Placing the emergency flasher button in a location that makes not easily accessible
## Suggest the improvements to make on the control interface. Sketch your solution and justify your design decisions. (Still working on it)
